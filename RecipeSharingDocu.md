Recipe Sharing Platform (Chef Savvy)

INTRODUCTION 

A "Recipe Sharing Platform" is an online service designed to connect culinary enthusiasts, home cooks, and professional chefs by enabling them to share, discover, and discuss recipes from around the world. These platforms provide a space where users can upload their favorite recipes, complete with detailed instructions, ingredient lists, and photos. Other users can browse these recipes, try them out, and leave feedback or ratings.

These platforms often include features such as search filters, allowing users to find recipes based on cuisine type, dietary preferences, cooking difficulty, and available ingredients. Many platforms also foster a sense of community by including forums, comment sections, or social networking features, where users can ask questions, offer tips, and share their cooking experiences.
